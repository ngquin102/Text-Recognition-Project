# Text-Recognition-Project
Text recognition also known as Optical Character Recognition (OCR), is the process of automatically identifying and extracting text from images or documents written in the English language. It involves utilizing advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to interpret images containing English text, converting them into machine-readable text data. This technology finds widespread use across industries for tasks such as document digitization, automated data entry, invoice processing, and content analysis. Text recognition systems preprocess input images, extract text regions, and apply OCR algorithms to accurately recognize and convert English characters, words, and sentences into digital format. With its ability to automate data extraction processes, improve information retrieval, enhance accessibility, and streamline workflows, text recognition plays a crucial role in facilitating efficient handling of textual content across various domains. <br>
In this project, I use EasyOCR, a Python library built on top of the PyTorch framework, is utilized for text recognition. EasyOCR provides a straightforward interface for Optical Character Recognition (OCR), enabling the automatic extraction of text from images or documents written in various languages, including English. By leveraging EasyOCR's capabilities, the project aims to accurately recognize and extract English text from a variety of sources, such as scanned documents, photographs, screenshots, or digital images. EasyOCR's ease of use and high accuracy make it a suitable choice for integrating OCR functionality into the project, facilitating tasks such as document digitization, automated data entry, and content analysis.<br>
